# Adding New Features

If you would like to add a new feature to Bundler, please follow these steps:

  1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/new) to discuss your feature.
  2. Base your commits on the master branch, since we follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) and don't add new features to old releases.
  3. Commit the code and at least one test covering your changes to a feature branch in your fork.
  4. Send us a [pull request](PULL_REQUESTS.md) from your feature branch.

If you don't hear back immediately, don't get discouraged! We all have day jobs, but we respond to most tickets within a day or two.

If you'd like to add a substantial feature to Bundler, refer to the [Bundler RFC process](https://github.com/bundler/rfcs) for more information.
