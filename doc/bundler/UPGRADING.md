# Upgrading

## Bundler 4

In order to prepare for Bundler 4, you can easily configure Bundler 2.7 to
behave exactly like Bundler 4 will behave. To do so, set the environment
variable `BUNDLE_SIMULATE_VERSION` to `4`. Alternatively, you can use `bundle
config` and enable "Bundler 4 mode" either globally through `bundle config set
--global simulate_version 4`, or locally through `bundle config set --local
simulate_version 4`. From now on in this document we will assume that all three
of these configuration options are available, but will only mention `bundle
config set <option> <value>`.

The following is a summary of the changes that we plan to introduce in Bundler
4, and why we will be making those changes. Some of them should be well known
already by existing users, because we have been printing deprecation messages
for years, but some of them are defaults that will be switched in Bundler 4 and
needs some heads up.

### Running just `bundle`  will print help usage

We're changing this default to make Bundler more friendly for new users. We do
understand that long time users already know how Bundler works and find useful
that just `bundle` defaults to `bundle install`. Those users can keep the
existing default by configuring

```
bundle config default_cli_command install
```

### Bundler will install to a `.bundle` folder relative to the Gemfile location by default

We're making this change to improve isolation. It will install gems to a
`.bundle` folder relative to the Gemfile location, instead of a global system folder.

The previous default of installing to system changes can be kept with `bundle
config path.system true`.

Related to this change, and to alleviate potential bad consequences from it,
we're also shipping some related changes:

* To keep disk usage under control, Bundler will cleanup unused gems when
  installing gems per application using the new default. This new behavior can
  be disabled by toggling back installing to system gems as explained before, or
  by configuring `bundle config clean false`.

* To avoid duplicate downloads of `.gem` packages and recompilation of
  extensions, Bundler will keep a global cache of gem packages and compiled
  extensions. This new behaviour can be disabled with `bundle config
  global_gem_cache false`, or by toggling back installing to system gems as
  explained before.

### Flags passed to `bundle install` that relied on being remembered across invocations will be removed

In particular, the `--clean`, `--deployment`, `--frozen`, `--no-prune`,
`--path`, `--shebang`, `--system`, `--without`, and `--with` options to `bundle
install`.

Remembering CLI options has been a source of historical confusion and bug
reports, not only for beginners but also for experienced users. A CLI tool
should not behave differently across exactly the same invocations _unless_
explicitly configured to do so. This is what configuration is about after all,
and things should never be silently configured without the user knowing about
it.

The problem with changing this behavior is that very common workflows are
relying on it. For example, when you run `bundle install --without
development:test` in production, those flags are persisted in the app's
configuration file and further `bundle` invocations will happily ignore
development and test gems.  This magic will disappear from bundler 4, and you
will explicitly need to configure it, either through environment variables,
application configuration, or machine configuration. For example, with `bundle
config set --local without development test`.

### Bundler will include checksums in the lockfile by default

We shipped this security feature recently and we believe it's time to turn it on
by default, so that everyone benefits from the extra security assurances by default.

### Strict source pinning in Gemfile is enforced by default

In bundler 4, the source for every dependency will be unambiguously defined, and
Bundler will refuse to run otherwise.

* Multiple global Gemfile sources will no longer be supported.

  Instead of something like this:

  ```ruby
  source "https://main_source"
  source "https://another_source"

  gem "dependency1"
  gem "dependency2"
  ```

  do something like this:

  ```ruby
  source "https://main_source"

  gem "dependency1"

  source "https://another_source" do
    gem "dependency2"
  end
  ```

* Global `path` and `git` sources will no longer be supported.

  Instead of something like this:

  ```ruby
  path "/my/path/with/gems"
  git "https://my_git_repo_with_gems"

  gem "dependency1"
  gem "dependency2"
  ```

  do something like this:

  ```ruby
  gem "dependency1", path: "/my/path/with/gems"
  gem "dependency2", git: "https://my_git_repo_with_gems"
  ```

  or use the block forms if you have multiple gems for each source and you want
  to be a bit DRYer:


  ```ruby
  path "/my/path/with/gems" do
    # gem "dependency1"
    # ...
    # gem "dependencyn"
  end

  git "https://my_git_repo_with_gems" do
    # gem "dependency1"
    # ...
    # gem "dependencyn"
  end
  ```

#### Notable CLI changes

* `bundle viz` will be removed and extracted to a plugin.

  This is the only bundler command requiring external dependencies, both an OS
  dependency (the `graphviz` package) and a gem dependency (the `ruby-graphviz`
  gem). Removing these dependencies will make development easier and it was also
  seen by the bundler team as an opportunity to develop a bundler plugin that
  it's officially maintained by the bundler team, and that users can take as a
  reference to develop their own plugins. The plugin will contain the same code
  as the old core command, the only difference being that the command is now
  implemented as `bundle graph` which is much easier to understand. However, the
  details of the plugin are under discussion. See [#3333](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/3333).

* The `bundle install` command will no longer accept a `--binstubs` flag.

  The `--binstubs` option has been removed from `bundle install` and replaced
  with the `bundle binstubs` command. The `--binstubs` flag would create
  binstubs for all executables present inside the gems in the project. This was
  hardly useful since most users will only use a subset of all the binstubs
  available to them. Also, it would force the introduction of a bunch of most
  likely unused files into source control. Because of this, binstubs now must
  be created and checked into version control individually.

* The `bundle inject` command will be replaced with `bundle add`

  We believe the new command fits the user's mental model better and it supports
  a wider set of use cases. The interface supported by `bundle inject` works
  exactly the same in `bundle add`, so it should be easy to migrate to the new
  command.

### Other notable changes

* Git and Path gems will be included in `vendor/cache` by default

  We're unsure why these gems were treated specially so we'll start caching them
  normally.

* Bundler will use cached local data if available when network issues are found
  during resolution.

  Just trying to provide a more resilient behavior here.

* `Bundler.clean_env`, `Bundler.with_clean_env`, `Bundler.clean_system`, and `Bundler.clean_exec` will be removed

  All of these helpers ultimately use `Bundler.clean_env` under the hood, which
  makes sure all bundler-related environment are removed inside the block it
  yields.

  After quite a lot user reports, we noticed that users don't usually want this
  but instead want the bundler environment as it was before the current process
  was started. Thus, `Bundler.with_original_env`, `Bundler.original_system`, and
  `Bundler.original_exec` were born. They all use the new `Bundler.original_env`
  under the hood.

  There's however some specific cases where the good old `Bundler.clean_env`
  behavior can be useful. For example, when testing Rails generators, you really
  want an environment where `bundler` is out of the picture. This is why we
  decided to keep the old behavior under a new more clear name, because we
  figured the word "clean" was too ambiguous. So we have introduced
  `Bundler.unbundled_env`, `Bundler.with_unbundled_env`,
  `Bundler.unbundled_system`, and `Bundler.unbundled_exec`.

* `Bundler.environment` is deprecated in favor of `Bundler.load`.

  We're not sure how people might be using this directly but we have removed the
  `Bundler::Environment` class which was instantiated by `Bundler.environment`
  since we realized the `Bundler::Runtime` class was the same thing. During the
  transition `Bundler.environment` will delegate to `Bundler.load`, which holds
  the reference to the `Bundler::Environment`.

* Deployment helpers for `vlad` and `capistrano` are being removed.

  These are natural deprecations since the `vlad` tool has had no activity for
  years whereas `capistrano` 3 has built-in Bundler integration in the form of
  the `capistrano-bundler` gem, and everyone using Capistrano 3 should be
  already using that instead. If for some reason, you are still using Capistrano
  2, feel free to copy the Capistrano tasks out of the Bundler 2 file
  `lib/bundler/deployment.rb` and put them into your app.

  In general, we don't want to maintain integrations for every deployment system
  out there, so that's why we are removing these.
