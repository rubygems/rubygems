	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb: added 'unpack' command.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (UnpackCommand): added.

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb (Installer#unpack): added.

2004-07-09  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/user_interaction.rb (Gem::StreamUI::ask and
	Gem::StreamUI::choose_from_list): Added flush before each gets.

2004-07-05  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command#defaults_str): added.

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command#create_option_parser):
	  Defaults for the options are included in the parser output.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb: all commands which have options
	  and defaults now have #defaults_str implemented.

2004-07-05  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command#create_option_parser):
	Make the argument and option sections optional.  They are only
	printed if there are options or arguments defined.

2004-07-05  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb:
	  - scrubbed up the 'help' command a bit, removing its options
	  - added information to 'help commands'

2004-07-04  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb:
	  - modified generic help and examples
	  - improved 'list' and 'search' help, and fixed bug in 'search'

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb: 
	  - explicit support for top-level commands --help and --version
	  - no more support for --examples and --commands

2004-07-04  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb:
	  - added 'list' and 'search' commands ('list' is no longer an alias
	    for 'query')
	  - modified return value from all 'arguments' methods (see command.rb)

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb: added 'search' command.

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb:
	    (Command#create_option_parser): enhanced the option parser for 'help'
	                                    display
	    (Command#remove_option): added (to support 'list' and 'search')

	* Rakefile: added 'gem' target.  Runs "local" (not installed) command
	  and libraries.

2004-07-04  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* Rakefile: added 'install' target.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb: code formatting.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb:
	  - refactored common install and update options into new module
	    InstallUpdateOptions
	      . consolidated option pairs (e.g. --test & --no-test ==> --[no-]test)
	      . --gen-rdoc is now --rdoc
	  - (UninstallCommand) corrected typo
	  - (InstallCommand) corrected output with local install

	* test/test_parse_commands.rb: :%s/--gen-rdoc/--rdoc/g

2004-07-03  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::InstallCommand::initialize):
	Added --no-gen-rdoc and --no-test to allow the user to override
	.gemrc default options.

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb (Gem::DocManager::generate_rdoc):
	Concatenate the local rdoc options to the end of the spec's rdoc
	options.
	(Gem::DocManager::configured_args): Added configured_args as a
	place to store local rdoc options.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_runner.rb (Gem::GemRunner::do_configuration):
	Configuration handled in do_configuration now.
	(Gem::GemRunner::do_configuration): Set the local rdoc
	configuration from the config file.

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command::handles): Added a
	handles? method to Command so that we can detect which extra
	arguments can be used with a command.
	(Gem::Command::add_extra_args): New method to add the config
	file's extra arguments to the front of the argument list.
	(Gem::Command::extra_args): Added extra_args to Command class to
	hold the extra args discovered in the config file.

	* Rakefile: Added TEST=filename option to all the test targets.

	* test/functional.rb (FunctionalTest::test_gemrc): Added
	functional test for gemrc.

	* scripts/gemdoc.data: Added an example to the specification command.

	* lib/rubygems.rb (Gem::Exception::manage_gems): Added gem_runner
	and config_file to manage_gems.
	(Gem::Exception::use_paths): use_paths now accepts (and ignores)
	nil parameters.

	* bin/gem: Make Gem::GemRunner the top level object.  It now
	creates and calls the CommandManager /after/ the arguments are
	processed.

	* Rakefile: Added test/data/gemhome to clobber list.

2004-07-01  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* test/test_specification.rb
	(TestSpecification::test_rdoc_files_included): Test for rdoc files
	included in file list.  Test for redundent file removal.

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb (Gem::Specification::validate):
	Added gem version to validation requirement.  Added normalize to
	remove redundent files in lists.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::InfoCommand::usage): Added
	usage and arguments methods for InfoCommand.
	(Gem::SpecificationCommand::usage): Fixed several usage comments.

2004-06-30  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::InstallCommand::usage):
	Upcased the comment on the usage statement (and corresponding
	option).  This makes the variable part of the command
	(e.g. GEMNAME) stand out from the static parts.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::CommandManager::process_args):
	Downcased commands before searching (allows upper case or mixed
	case for commands on command line).

	* install.rb (install_rb): Fixed bug where the installer falsely
	triggered the old repository upgrade when the directory part of
	the file contained the matching "-digits." pattern.  Now the
	pattern must be in the file's base name.

2004-06-26  Gavin Sinclair  <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>

	* scripts/specdoc.rb: added (to generate gem specificiation document)
	* scripts/specdoc.data: added (supports specdoc.rb)
	* scripts/specdoc.yaml: added (supports specdoc.rb)

2004-06-27  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* scripts/gemdoc.data Removed extraneous <em> marker. 

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb
	(Gem::Specification::satisfies_requirement): HA!  Caught another
	version_requirement vs version_requirements error.  (I really
	regret the decision to change that name.)

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb (Gem::Uninstaller::has_dependents):
	Changed call to alert to alert_warning.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::UninstallCommand::execute):
	Again, remove local error handling to allow the error to perculate
	up the chain to the top level.

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb (Gem::DocManager::generate_rdoc):
	Removed one level of exception handling.  Only catching RDocErrors
	at the outermost level.  And instead of reporting the error and
	swallowing it, I convert it to a Gem::DocumentError (with the same
	error message).  This is for better error handling.

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command::handle_options): Removed
	exception handling from handle_options.  This allows errors to be
	handled at the top level.  Makes for a more consistent error
	interface.

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb (Gem::DocumentError): Added
	DocumentError to wrap RDocErrors (which derive from Exception
	... yuck).

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::RemoteError): RemoteError and
	LocalInstallationError are now Gem::Exceptions (rather than
	StandardErrors).  

	* lib/rubygems.rb (Gem::Exception): Changed base of Gem::Exception
	to RuntimeError (was ::Exception).  Apps using gem as a library
	would have to catch Gem::Exceptions explicitly (yuck), or catch
	Exceptions generically.  Catching Exceptions will catch
	EVERYTHING, including things like SystemExit.  By makeing
	Gem::Exception a RuntimeError, apps can catch RuntimeError or even
	StandardError.

2004-06-26  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* test/functional.rb (FunctionalTest::test_all_command_helps):
	Added functional test to show all commands have usage messaegs.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::HelpCommand::execute): Added
	version option to help (gem help version).
	(Gem): Cleaned up the help text.  Dropped unneeded verbage.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb
	(Gem::CommandManager::find_command_possibilities): Added
	find_command_possibilities to help the Help command look for
	commands.

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb (Gem::Uninstaller::uninstall): Fixed
	null pointer bug where a list was destroyed in a method.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::BuildCommand::load_gemspecs):
	yaml gemspec files are now accepted by the build command.

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command::parser): Created an
	on-demand option parser for all commands.
	(Gem::Command::handle_options): Command line option hash is now
	and instance variable with a reader.

	* Rakefile: Linked package version to the value in the rubygems.rb
	file.  The gem env command now shows both gem version (e.g. 0.6)
	and the package version (e.g. 0.6.1).

2004-06-25  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::InfoCommand): Dropped the
	version command (its available via gem env).  Added a gem info
	command to extract the yaml from a gemfile.
	(Gem::LocalRemoteOptions): Refactored the local/remote options
	(adding and testing) into a mixin module.

	* test/test_version_comparison.rb
	(TestDependencies::test_normalization): Added some tests for the
	normalization issues mentions below.

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb (Gem::Dependency::normalize): Old gems
	have requirements and dependencies incoded in the Yaml spec in an
	out of date format.  When loaded, they have incorrect instance
	variables for modern objects.  I added a normalize call to handle
	transforming out dated objects in to modern objects. (Remember
	this next time we change the data structure of something in the
	spec file.)
	(Gem::Version::Requirement::parse): Requirements are comparable
	now, just so that we can test them with asserts.

	* lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb
	(Gem::RemoteInstaller::find_dependencies_not_installed): Fixed
	recursive call to require_gem to properly pass dependency
	information.
	
	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb (Gem::Uninstaller::has_dependents):
	Fixed reference to version_requirement (needs to be plural).

	* lib/rubygems/command.rb (Gem::Command::invoke): Command now
	handles it own help messages.  Commands no longer have to return
	true/false to trigger help messages.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::CommandManager::process_args):
	Moved help handling into the help command.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::HelpCommand): Renamed the
	base command to HelpCommand and made it handle a lot of the help
	options.  Still need work on individual command helps.

	* test/functional.rb (FunctionalTest::test_env_version): Added a
	bunch of new functional tests for the environment command.

	* lib/rubygems/gem_commands.rb (Gem::InstallCommand::execute):
	Made multiple gem names an error for now.  Should look at later.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::ListCommand): Added list as an
	alias to query.
	(Gem::UpdateCommand::initialize): Corrected spelling of install
	(intall) in several places.

	* bin/gem_server: Added Gem.manage_gems to the gem_server to fix
	missing requirements.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::InstallCommand::initialize):
	Added missing --both option to install.

	* test/test_command.rb
	(TestCommand::test_invode_with_bad_options): Catch the termination
	request.

	* test/mockgemui.rb (MockGemUi::terminate_interaction): Make the
	mock UI throw an exception when a termination is requested.  This
	makes sure that we don't miss accidental terminations.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::CommandManager::find_command):
	Added find_command to handle best matching command names.

	* test/functional.rb (FunctionalTest::test_build): Updated
	functional tests to use the new command structure.

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb (Gem::Version::Requirement): Changed the
	pessimistic version comparison operator to "~>".  I like to think
	of it as "approximately greater than".  (It was ">*").

	* bin/gem: Moved gem2 into the standard gem script location.  It
	is now stable enough to use as the standard command.

	* lib/rubygems/cmd_manager.rb (Gem::CommandManager::run): Added
	run method to trap errors while running commands.  Makes for
	prettier output.
	(Gem::CommandManager): Move *all* commands to their own classes.
	Simplified CommandManager.  Lowered the coupling between
	CommandManager and the Commands (the commands don't even need to
	know about the manager anymore).  CommandManager maybe created
	with "new" for testing (the script will continue to use
	"instance").
	(Gem::RubyGemsInfoCommand): New command.
	(Gem::VersionCommand): New command.

2004-06-24  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>
	
	* lib/rubygems/user_interaction.rb (Gem::UserInteraction):
	Significantly rewrote the whole user interaction scheme.  We are
	now using an UI object that responds to the standard list of UI
	commands (e.g. say, alert, ask).  The UserInteraction module
	defines all the interaction methods to be forwarded to the default
	UI objects.  The "ui" method returns that default object (and you
	can use self.ui=(new_ui) to change it).  Also the use_ui(new_ui) {
	} command is convienent for switching the UI object for a short
	period of time.

2004-06-18  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * broke test_cmd_manager.rb into test_parse_commands and 
        test_process_commands to test the parsing of command line options
        and the funtionality, respectively. 

2004-06-18  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * added new unit test file: test/test_cmd_manager.rb to test the 
        command manager classes.  this is just the first few tests which
        will be expanded to a full test suite.

2004-06-17  Chad FOwler <chad@chadfowler.com>

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Fixed bug in windows batch file generation
	which was causing file not found errors.
        * lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Uninstall now removes scripts and batch 
        * lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Fixed install bug.  Thanks to Mark 
        Sparshatt for the fix (via the rubyforge bug tracker). 

2004-06-17  Jim Weirich  <jim@weirichhouse.org>

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb (Gem::DocManager::generate_rdoc):
	Changed rdoc generation to do a chdir into the base source
	directory and then to use a relative path for all the source
	files.  This makes the generated RDOC html look better and may fix
	the windows drive/rdoc bug as a side effect.

2004-06-17  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * Added ability to capture the UserInteraction with:
          c = Gem::UserInteraction.capture
          and then you can override specific methods like 'say':
          c.on_say {|statement| puts "you said: #{statement}"}

2004-06-15  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * Added refactored command handling in rubygems/cmd_manager.rb and a 
          (temporary) bin/gem2 command file to test things out.  Once we feel
          comfortable, we can replace gem with gem2.

2004-06-10  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * Isolated all user interaction to pass through module methods on a new
          Gem::UserInteraction module.  Those methods will be the method of abstracting
          the interaction of RubyGems for use in a GUI-based solution.

2004-06-10  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
        * require 'rubygems' now minimally requires only the files needed
          for runtime access to gems...not management of gems.  To manage
          gems you now additionally need to execute Gem::manage_gems prior
          to using the builder/installer/etc.  This makes gemspecs not 
          backward compatible unless they add that line to the gemspec 
          after the require 'rubygems' line.

2004-06-10  Gavin Sinclair <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>
	* bin/gem: --upgrade-all was broken, probably as a result of the
	  search changes listed below.

2004-06-09  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* lib/rubygems/remote_install.rb: delegate search functionality to
	  Cache class, bringing remote and local search and list together into
	  one piece of code.
	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/validator.rb: move all STDIO work to bin/gem.
	  Validator.alien now returns a hash of ErrorData objects.
	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/installer.rb: move most of the STDIO stuff to
	  bin/gem, communicating via exceptions in this case.

2004-06-08  Rich Kilmer  <rich@infoether.com>
	* Fixed the drive problem on win32 (hopefully) so multiple drives
	  should now work.  Its still a hack until rdoc is fixed.

2004-06-08  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* Fixed bug caused by method change on Version::Requirement

2004-06-08  Rich Kilmer <rich@infoether.com>
	* fixed bug in doc_manager.rb whereby the extra_rdoc_files should
	  be appended to the list of directories prior to prepending the
	  full path.

2004-06-08  Gavin Sinclair <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>
	* bin/gem_server: List installed gems in [name,version] order.

2004-06-08  Gavin Sinclair <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>
	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: don't warn about not being able to
	  install a library stub if a library stub is already installed.
	  Still warn if it's not a library stub that's there already.

2004-06-08  Gavin Sinclair <gsinclair@soyabean.com.au>
	* bin/gem: renamed --upgrade-dist to --upgrade--all and fixed bug.
	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: fixed bug with Ruby version assertion.

2004-06-07  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb, lib/rubygems/version.rb: Fixed old
	  dependency on #version method for Gem::Version::Requirement
	* bin/gem: new --upgrade-dist option allows one to upgrade every
	  installed gem
	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb,lib/rubygems/installer.rb: new
	  #required_ruby_version attribute added to gem specification for specifying a
	  dependency on which version of ruby the gem needs.	Format it accepts is
	  the same as the Gem::Version::Requirement format.

2004-06-06  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* bin/gem: install_stub is once again the default due to requests.

2004-06-04  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb, lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb:  
	Allow arbitrary files to be added for rdoc to run over them (as per
	Jim's request).

2004-06-04  Chad Fowler  <chad@chadfowler.com>
	* bin/gem:  Reformatted --search and --list output such that
	multiple versions of a gem are compressed into a single entry
	(with version numbers in parentheses)

2004-05-31  Jim Weirich  <jweirich@one.net>

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb (Gem::Dependency): Dependency attribute
	renamed to version_requirements (made plural).
	(Gem::Version::bump): Added bump to implement pessimistic
	operator.
	(Gem::Version::Requirement): Added pessimistic operator to list of
	operators. Operators now implemented using lambda.

	* lib/rubygems.rb (Kernel::require_gem): require_gem now takes an
	array of requirement strings.

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb (Gem::Version::Requirement::initialize):
	Simplified initialization by making parse a bit smarter.
	(Gem::Version::Requirement::satisfied_by): Simplified by using
	all?
	(Gem::Version::Requirement::satisfy): Added explicit one
	requirement satisfy test.
	(Gem::Version::Requirement::parse): parse now returns a two
	element string array (operator and version string).  We don't
	bother converting to an integer array during parsing.

2004-05-31 18:38 chadfowler

	* gemspec now supports #rdoc_options, to which you can append
	strings that will be passed to rdoc as additional options.

2004-05-08 21:57  chadfowler

	* Using Gem::RubyGemsVersion to match the release number.  If we
	need to use this as an internal version format specifier in the
	future, we can use the Gem::Version semantics.

2004-05-30 14:33 gsinclair

	* bin/gem: Split --help into --help (basic), --help-options (what
	  --help used to be), and --help-examples.

2004-04-30 15:57  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: --install-stub is no longer the default ;)

2004-04-30 15:51  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Rich Kilmer (who kicks butt) figured
	  out how to fix the library stub stuff.

2004-04-29 19:12  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb: Dick Davies fixed a bug in the doc
	  generator.

2004-04-29 13:41  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Added skeleton code and comments to
	  uninstall stub apps and libs

2004-04-29 12:20  gsinclair

	* install.rb: Don't install library stub for 'sources'

2004-04-29 12:20  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Improvements to library stub
	  installation: * don't overwrite existing file (emit warning) *
	  nice warning if there's a permission problem * observe
	  --[no-]install-stub flag (rather, observe the argument to
	  #install)

2004-04-29 12:16  gsinclair

	* bin/gem: --install-stub is now the default

2004-04-26 20:20  chadfowler

	* test/test_remote_installer.rb: Cleaning up after Gavin and his
	  test-breaking self. ;)

2004-04-26 12:06  gsinclair

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb: Installing a gem now causes a
	  library stub to be installed as well, allowing you to require
	  'package' without knowing it's a gem.

2004-04-25 23:18  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/: installer.rb, specification.rb: Prompt user if
	  trying to uninstall a gem that other gems *may* depend on.

2004-04-25 09:27  chadfowler

	* test/test_remote_installer.rb: Changed expected test results to
	  match new (old) gem naming scheme--"ruby" doesn't appear as a
	  platform in the gem name.

2004-04-25 05:50  gsinclair

	* bin/gem: Changed @directory -> @install_dir for clarity

2004-04-25 05:47  gsinclair

	* bin/gem: Improved display of gems, platform-wise

2004-04-25 05:46  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Added documentation

2004-04-25 04:17  jimweirich

	* test/functional.rb: Fixed functional test to properly name a Ruby
	  platform gem.

2004-04-25 04:17  jimweirich

	* packages/sources/.cvsignore, test/data/one/.cvsignore: Ignore the
	  proper gem name.

2004-04-25 04:17  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Undefined several attributes that
	  were redefined to avoid warnings.

2004-04-25 04:17  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems.rb: Need to initialize @gem_home and @gem_path with
	  ||= to avoid warning.

2004-04-25 03:40  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems.rb, test/test_gempaths.rb: RUBY_GEMS -> GEM_PATH
	  (environment variable)

2004-04-25 03:33  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Pretty-print the specification

2004-04-25 03:18  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Handle platform in a (hopefully)
	  consistent manner

2004-04-25 03:16  gsinclair

	* install.rb: Use return value from Builder#build to locate gem
	  file

2004-04-25 03:09  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/builder.rb: Return file name from #build

2004-04-25 02:32  gsinclair

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Platform goes at the *end* of the

	  More improved error messages (don't show stack trace when using
	  bin/gem)

2004-04-04 20:43  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/validator.rb: Mauricio fixed a problem with alien
	  (just failed to update it when we changed the gem directory), but
	  now there's another issue I can't find.  Anyway, this fix is
	  obviously needed.  But alien is broken anyway.

	  checking for gem specs to make sure they have all required

	  that it didn't have a require_path.

2004-04-02 07:48  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb: Prompt for installation of
	  dependenciees.

	  For now, there is a puts/gets in the middle of
	  remote_installer.rb  This should probably be cleaned up later
	  (return control flow to the gem program to install the
	  dependencies, for example.

2004-04-02 07:37  chadfowler

	* TODO: [no log message]

2004-04-02 07:34  chadfowler

	  add earlier.

2004-04-02 07:29  chadfowler

	* example/: test.gemspec, lib/test.rb, lib/test/wow.rb: Removing

	  organized).

2004-04-02 07:26  chadfowler

	  better way to do it.

2004-03-31 19:13  chadfowler

	  lib/rubygems/validator.rb, test/test_all.rb,

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: allow passing parameters to extconf.rb
	  with:

	  everything past the -- will go to the extconf.rb...just like
	  setup.rb

2004-03-30 02:34  rich

	* lib/rubygems/: installer.rb, specification.rb: very initial
	  capability to build source gems.  this only lets you build native
	  extensions so long as you do not have to specify --with-
	  directories

2004-03-29 08:31  rich

	* install.rb: switched migration of old gems to new ./gems subdir
	  to use FileUtils rather than ftools...hope to fix reported win32
	  error.

	  directory structure

2004-03-28 21:30  rich

	* install.rb, lib/rubygems.rb, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/specification.rb: changed path of installed gems to
	  be:

	  ruby/gems/1.8/gems

	  which cleans up the root.

2004-03-28 18:53  chadfowler

	* test/test_all.rb: This is the file to run for all of the tests.

	  test_remote_installer is commented out for now.  The open URI

	  but a little harder to test.

	  alarms in the validator.

2004-03-27 08:23  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: No longer have an option to pass http proxy host into
	  the gem program.  Only reads it from the environment.  This is
	  because George's patch (and open-uri) work this way, and I'm lazy
	  right now.

2004-03-27 08:17  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb: George Marrows' nice patch to
	  remove a bunch of code from remote_installer.

	  Our remote_installer tests are failing.  We really need to start
	  paying attention to the test directory. :(`

	  run tests if none are included with the gem

	* bin/gem, example/lib/test.rb, lib/rubygems/cache.rb,

2003-11-29 17:27  jimweirich

	* Rakefile: added Rakefile to package

2003-11-29 16:23  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Removed defined? and initialized
	  @platform

2003-11-29 16:08  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Initialized @loaded and check
	  defined?(@platform) to silence some -w warnings.

2003-11-29 09:26  rich

	* bin/gem_server, lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb: updated to support
	  /doc URL to generate list of installed gems w/doc link for rdoc
	  generated links.

2003-11-29 08:30  rich

	* lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb: minor format change of error message

2003-11-29 08:29  rich

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/builder.rb, lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/installer.rb: instantiates DocManager now.  errors
	  out on no install of RDoc.  warns if .gemspec does not specify
	  having rdoc, but rdoc is generated

2003-11-29 02:13  rich

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems.rb, lib/rubygems/doc_manager.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/format.rb, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/specification.rb: added capability to generate rdoc
	  on install of gem (--gen-rdoc).  this doc is placed in
	  Gem.dir+doc+gem.full_name fixed but in installer when moving to
	  format (not calling each) added doc manager to add/remove
	  documenatation (right now only rdoc)

2003-11-29 01:28  rich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: should not define the attr_readers
	  for requirements/dependencies so undef is unnecessary

2003-11-29 00:12  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Undefing dependencies and
	  requirements removes warning when used with -w.

2003-11-29 00:12  jimweirich

	* lib/rubygems.rb: Using defined?($GEM_PATH) avoids warning when
	  used with -w switch.

2003-11-28 15:58  chadfowler

	* bin/gem, example/test.gemspec, lib/rubygems.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/installer.rb, lib/rubygems/validator.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/format.rb: Separated gem file reading into a
	  separate class/file.

2003-11-28 15:20  rich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: added has_rdoc?/has_rdoc methods
	  ... will be used to autogenerate rdoc

2003-11-28 12:30  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/validator.rb: Rdoc added

2003-11-28 11:51  chadfowler

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems.rb, lib/rubygems/validator.rb: A little
	  rearranging of the validation/alien code.  It's still ugly, but
	  at least it's in its own file now. :)

2003-11-28 11:40  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Removed a little cruft.

2003-11-27 11:04  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Print success message for each gem *not* containing
	  errors.

2003-11-27 11:00  chadfowler

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/installer.rb: Preliminary support for gem
	  directory validation (--alien).  Looks for bad or missing gem
	  files, missing spec files, files installed that aren't part of
	  the gem, checksum mismatches, etc.

	  Very ugly code.  Very ugly output.  Work in progress.

2003-11-24 11:58  rich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: change full_name to include
	  platform

2003-11-24 09:15  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Option for HTTP Proxy server for remote-install.  Not
	  yet implemented.

2003-11-23 20:22  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/builder.rb: Removed a stray \" in builder's success
	  message

2003-11-23 20:16  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Leaving escape in but commenting
	  out its functionality because it hosed some other things up.
	  Need to revisit this for the case where:

	   s.summary = "Chad's Thing" # It's the apostrophe

2003-11-23 20:08  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: Escape quotes to avoid invalid
	  gemspecs in the #{Gem.dir}/specifications directory

2003-11-23 19:21  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Less ugly error message on file IO problems.

2003-11-22 22:34  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Very simple support for validating a gem.  Will probably
	  move this into the libs eventually.

2003-11-22 20:53  chadfowler

	* example/test.gemspec, lib/rubygems/builder.rb: Generate MD5
	  checksum for gem and store it in the file.  Will be used to
	  validate gem file before installation.

2003-11-22 13:58  chadfowler

	* install.rb, lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb,
	  packages/sources/sources.gemspec,
	  packages/sources/lib/sources.rb: remote-install sources are now
	  installed as a ruby gem at the time of rubygems installation.
	  sources gemspec included in the rubygems distribution.

2003-11-22 12:52  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Allow gem info by --version

2003-11-22 11:50  chadfowler

	* lib/: rubygems.rb, rubygems/cache.rb: Fixed the bug I introduced
	  by fixing Rich's bug with gem cache caching. ;)

	  Gem::Cache now has a #refresh! method.

2003-11-22 10:16  chadfowler

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems.rb, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb: - Fixed bug in Gem.cache
	  (though we may want to revisit it for in-memory caching - Command
	  line configurable version for uninstall

2003-11-22 00:28  rich

	* lib/rubygems/cache.rb: rdoc'd search method

2003-11-22 00:24  rich

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/cache.rb, lib/rubygems/version.rb,
	  test/test_version_comparison.rb: removed search_by_name because
	  search does the same thing.  version::requirement was updated to
	  that if you did not specific a version operation, it assumes an =
	  sign.  updated tests accordingly

2003-11-21 23:58  rich

	* lib/rubygems/: cache.rb, installer.rb: allow version to be
	  specified in uninstall (if called programatically)

2003-11-21 23:52  rich

	* lib/: rubygems.rb, rubygems/cache.rb, rubygems/installer.rb,
	  rubygems/specification.rb: > moved all searching into cache..and
	  now search by name/version and return an
	  ordered list (.last == highest version).
	  > modified uninstaller to allow selecting a specific version to
	  uninstall if
	  multiple versions are installed.
	  > implemented comparison function on specification.
	  > changed require_gem to use new search of cache function

2003-11-21 21:06  chadfowler

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/remote_installer.rb: Added ability to
	  specify optional version requirement for remote installations

2003-11-21 20:25  chadfowler

	* test/test_remote_installer.rb: Removed carriage returns

2003-11-21 19:04  chadfowler

	* bin/gem_server: Converted from getopts to optparse.

2003-11-21 18:31  rich

	* lib/rubygems.rb: changed the order in which operations are
	  performed in require_gem.  it now requires dependent gems prior
	  to adding the require_paths to a gem.  otherwise we could have
	  had a LoadError on a dependent gem but the paths were already
	  added...potential problem

2003-11-21 18:21  rich

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: updated to ensure
	  (specifications/cache) directories exist for a provided path

2003-11-21 18:01  rich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: updated rdoc

2003-11-21 17:59  rich

	* bin/gem, lib/rubygems/builder.rb, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/specification.rb: fixed various bugs with the
	  $GEM_PATH stuff, specifically on uninstall.  Also, changed to
	  allow specifying a directory on install (--dir) and force install
	  (--force).  Changed the builder generated ruby header to use
	  optparse.

2003-11-21 07:03  chadfowler

	* lib/: rubygems.rb, rubygems/cache.rb,
	  rubygems/remote_installer.rb: Remote installation of dependencies
	  now works.  It downloads all dependent gems or errors out.

	  Fixed bug in require_gem.  Wrong call to cache.

2003-11-21 00:59  rich

	* bin/gem, example/test.gemspec, lib/rubygems.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/cache.rb, lib/rubygems/installer.rb,
	  lib/rubygems/specification.rb: added capability to support
	  multiple paths $GEM_PATH in Ruby and RUBY_GEMS in the ARGV.  Lots
	  of changes were needed to support this.  also added the --force
	  and --dir options to gem installtion

2003-11-20 22:50  chadfowler

	* bin/gem: Switched to optparse.  Not a whole lot gained, but it
	  seems to be the way Ruby is going.  It's nice not to have to do
	  the "when" stuff, I guess.

2003-11-19 23:41  chadfowler

	* lib/rubygems/: installer.rb, remote_installer.rb: Added
	  chadfowler.com to the hardcoded remote install list.

	  Fixed a dangling YAML.load that broke uninstall.

2003-11-19 22:56  rich

	* lib/rubygems.rb: fixed bug in loading rubygems

2003-11-19 22:51  chadfowler

	* bin/: gem_server, gem_server.cgi: require 'yaml' :)

2003-11-19 22:44  rich

	* lib/: rubygems.rb, rubygems/cache.rb, rubygems/specification.rb:
	  changed the format of stuff stored in the spec directory to ruby
	  instead of YAML.  This allows us to not have to load yaml in
	  'require_gem'.  switched the specification list to a Cache
	  object.

2003-11-19 21:56  rich

	* lib/rubygems/installer.rb: write the spec file in ruby and not in
	  yaml format (in the spec dir)

2003-11-19 20:32  rich

	* lib/rubygems/specification.rb: added to_ruby method to generate a
	  ruby string that can be eval'ed in to build a Gem Specification

2003-11-17 21:37  jimweirich

	* bin/: gem_server, gem_server.cgi: removed carriage returns

2003-11-17 21:19  chadfowler

	* install.rb: Accidentally left some junk in the file.

2003-11-17 19:50  dblack

	* test/test_version_comparison.rb: * Test cases for Version.rb

2003-11-17 19:50  dblack

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb: * Split off tests into
	  rubygems/tests/test_version_comparison.rb

2003-11-17 12:37  chadfowler

	* install.rb: Create File.join(Config::CONFIG['libdir'], "ruby",
	  "gems") + "specifications" and + "cache" during installation.

	  Need to remove this from rubygems.rb and replace with
	  ensure_directory call.

2003-11-17 12:29  rich

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb: rdoc added

2003-11-17 11:31  rich

	  renamed some variables

2003-11-17 08:48  dblack

	* lib/rubygems/version.rb: * Added stricter checking of incoming
	  Requirement string

	  * Added unit tests at end of file

2003-11-17 07:32  chadfowler

	* bin/: gem_server, gem_server.cgi: Refactored gem_server program
	  and added an equivalent CGI version.

2003-11-17 00:14  rich
