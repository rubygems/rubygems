Release 0.5.0: Jun 6, 2004
  * Jim added the ability to specify version constraints to avoid API incompatibilities.  This has been the subject of much debate for the past couple of months, with many ideas and code contributed by Eivind Eklund and Mauricio Fernandez.  The following set of assertions shows how it works:
    assert_inadequate("1.3", ">* 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.4", ">* 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.5", ">* 1.4")
    assert_inadequate("2.0", ">* 1.4") # This one is key--the new operator disallows major version number differences.

  * Group gem search output when multiple versions exist for a given gem:
  activerecord (0.7.8, 0.7.7, 0.7.6, 0.7.5)
    Implements the ActiveRecord pattern for ORM.

  * Add arbitrary RDoc-able files via gemspec (not just Ruby source files)  for people who have, for example, README.rdoc in their distributions.  Add to gemspec via: spec.extra_rdoc_files = ["list", "of", "files"].  Ruby files are automatically included.

  * Some small bug fixes

  
Release 0.4.0: May 31, 2004

  * Cleanup of command-line arguments and handling.  Most commands accept a --local or --remote modifier.
  * Creation of Application Gems (packages that include executable programs).  See http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?DeveloperGuide for information on how to use it.
  * Basic functionality for installing binary gems from source (:extensions property of gem specification holds an array of paths to extconf.rb files to be used for compilation)
  * Install library "stub" allowing a normal 'require' to work (which then does the rubygems require and 'require_gem'
  * --run-tests runs the test suite specified by the "test_suite_file" property of a gem specification
  * HTTP Proxy support works.  Rewrite of HTTP code.
  * Unit and functional tests added (see Rakefile).
  * Prompt before remote-installing dependencies during gem installation.
  * Config file for storing preferences for 'gem' command usage.
  * Generally improved error messages (still more work to do)
  * Rearranged gem directory structure for cleanliness.
